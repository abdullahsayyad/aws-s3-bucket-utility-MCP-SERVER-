This tool is an AWS S3 bucket utility built for MCP Server, allowing seamless interaction with S3 storage. It lets LLMs list available buckets, retrieve stored objects, and filter for CSV files, with built-in async support using aioboto3. Developers can integrate either locally or via Docker. The tool is optimized for automation, making S3 access smoother and more scalable.
